					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p> I have been in IT for right around 6 years now, 3 spent in education, and 3 in healthcare.
						During my years in education I trained alongside System Administrators and Site Technicians.
						This is where I was introduced to an enterpise environment, paving the way for a lot of the
						skills I have now. After leaving the education sector, I took a job at Anmed Health Hospital System.
						The hospital was a very good transition and I took to the healthcare environment quickly. We support
						around 5,500 devices and 3,500 users across two 1m sqft facilities and around 15 off site clinics.
						Here I have had the great opportunity to learn a lot of systems and train along side many different 
						roles. During my time at Anmed I have been focusing my studies towards cloud solutions, and backend
						engineering. My main cloud focus being in AWS. Outside of work I do spend many hours in my homelab,
						learning new technologies and keeping my skills sharp. I selfhost this static page and my website,
						alongside a few other apps and services. This industry is definitely more than a career to me, its a passion
						of mine. I really enjoy being on the cutting edge of constant innovation and endless learning.
